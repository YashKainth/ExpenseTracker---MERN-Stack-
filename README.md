## Technology Used (MERN Stack)

ExpenseTracker is built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Each technology plays a crucial role in the application's architecture:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, perfect for handling diverse data structures.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies the process of building robust APIs.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of reusable UI components and providing a responsive user experience.
- **Node.js**: A server-side JavaScript runtime that powers the backend server, handling user authentication, data retrieval, and other server-side operations.

### Significance of MERN Stack

The MERN stack offers several advantages for our ExpenseTracker project:

1. **Full Stack JavaScript**: Using JavaScript for both the frontend and backend streamlines development, leading to faster development cycles.  
2. **Real-time Updates**: React ensures real-time updates, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.  
3. **Scalability**: MongoDB's flexibility and scalability allow the application to grow with its user base.  
4. **Community and Support**: The MERN stack has a vibrant community, ensuring access to numerous resources, libraries, and plugins.  
5. **Performance**: Node.js and React are designed for high performance, making the application fast and efficient.
